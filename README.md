EvoPop 3.18
===

This is a fork of [EvoPop](https://github.com/solus-cold-storage/evopop-gtk-theme.git) that try to keep alive this amazing theme.
So the main aim is adding support for gnome 3.18.

###Collaborations:
Please, if you are familiar with Gtk theming we need you!

####Tip:
I'm newbbie to Gtk theme, and I spent a lot of time to figure out how to test changes.
The secret is to run make install every time you need to test your changes.

EvoPop
====

A simple, flat and bold Gtk theme for Solus OS & Budgie Desktop.
Iris Dark was used as base.

This project is still a work in progress.
Requires Gtk 3.16 & gtk-engine-murrine to function properly.

###Notice:
Since i had unfixable issues with the window controls support for 3.14 & unity is dropped.
However a version of the theme with normal window controls named [BasePop](https://github.com/poltertec/basepop-gtk-theme) can be used.

###Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file & run the included install script.

    sh autogen.sh
    sudo make install

Use Budgie settings to change the theme to EvoPop.
